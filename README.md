Welcome to GreenwayNYC!

This iOS app was developed by <a href= "https://github.com/ezaman">Ehsan</a>, <a href= "https://github.com/jmkiley">Jordan</a>, <a href= "https://github.com/kenpcjr">Ken</a>, and <a href= "https://github.com/TiciaChance">Laticia</a> for their capstone project at the Flatiron School.

GreenwayNYC uses open data provided by Data.gov to help connect New Yorkers with parks, farmers markets, and community gardens. The goal is to promote outdoor activity and emotional wellbeing. GreenwayNYC also provides the user Air Quality Index data to help the user decide whether outdoor activity is right for them.

To build GreenwayNYC, we used the following APIs from Data.gov/the City of New York:

<a href= "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/parks-properties">Park Properties</a>
<a href= "https://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Farmers-Markets-in-New-York-State-API/xjya-f8ng">Farmers Markets</a>



As of 8/23/16, GreenwayNYC is written in Swift 2.3.
